				<h2>Synopsis</h2>
				<div class="text-content">
					<p>A freight train rolls through a vast grassland stretching out before the Caucasus mountains. At the wheel: Nurlan, the train driver. Day in, day out, he steers his train through a densely populated suburb of Baku, where the rails are so close to the houses that Nurlan practically drives through the residents' anterooms and gardens. On his daily route, he passes men drinking tea as well as women hanging their laundry in the gentle breeze. As soon as the train approaches, the little orphan boy Aziz blows a whistle and the suburb's residents quickly get themselves and their belongings to safety. But this doesn't always work. Nurlan has already picked quite a few things off his locomotive: chicken feathers, toy balls, and even bedsheets. On the last day of work before his retirement, a particularly special farewell gift gets caught on Nurlan's engine: a fantastically beautiful blue lace bra. After his shift, Nurlan simply takes it with him to his home village in the mountains. His curiosity is piqued: Who might this small piece of fabric belong to? Driven by loneliness, Nurlan decides to take up the search for the owner of the bra.</p>
					<p>THE BRA is a story told with great sensitivity and lightheartedness about the search for love. Once again, director Veit Helmer is drawn to the mountain landscape of Azerbaijan. In his masterfully imaginative visual language, he lives up to his reputation as a modern storyteller and stages THE BRA as an atmospheric comedy that manages entirely without dialogue and precisely for this reason captivates us.</p>
