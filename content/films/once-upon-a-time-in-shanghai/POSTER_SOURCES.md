## Special Considerations for Documentary

Since this is a documentary rather than a feature film, traditional "posters" may not exist. Alternative approaches:

### Option 1: Key Documentary Still
- Representative frame from the film
- Shows railway tracks passing through neighborhood
- Residents and daily life visible
- Railway "Shanghai" district atmosphere captured

### Option 2: Production Still
- Behind-the-scenes image showing neighborhood
- Documentary filming in progress
- Authentic location photography

### Option 3: Composite Image
- Create poster-style image from key stills
- Feature: railway tracks, houses, daily life
- Text overlay: Title, director, year (if needed)
