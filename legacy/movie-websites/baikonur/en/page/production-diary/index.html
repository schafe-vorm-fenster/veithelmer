						We left the hotel at 7 am. We arrived at the hangar shortly after,
						as we stay in a hotel near the airport. Marie got an injection
						against motion sickness. Unfortunately it made her sleepy for 30
						minutes and I could not tell her last directions. At 9 am
						Novespace kicked me out of the plane and closed the doors. Then
						the plane took off for four hours! It made 31 parabolas. I was
						very nervous, waiting on the ground. After half of the flight, I
						got the message, that Marie is fine. My biggest fear, that Marie
						might get sick, did not happen. At 12.50 h, the plane landet.
						There were many scientist on board, then Marie stepped out. She
						was happy and exited. Also Michael Müller from DLR seemed to be
						satisfied, he played a cosmonaut in the scene! They shot all
						according to the schedule, expect the scene with the brush.<br />
						Unfortunately the film did not last for all parabolas. The crew
						from Novespace was really helpful during the shooting, Marie told
						me. So thank you Christophe, Stephane and Frederic and also staff
						from DLR!<br /> The Airbus 300 Zero G made its 10000 parabola
						today and Marie got a medal, that she was part of that flight!

						Today was the first flight day. But we are only allowed to shoot
						on day 2 and 3. I used the day to make a detailed preparation. I
						wrote a precise shooting schedule for the plane operator Novespace
						and the German Space Agency DLR. I went with Marie de Villepin and
						our special cameramen Pierre Weller inside the plane after it came
						back, to<br /> discuss the angles for the shooting day 1. Nikolai
						helped to make the camera working, as pieces had not arrived by
						UPS and we need to build the handset ourselve! The camera is
						really huge, even I chosen the smallest lens and a small matte
						box.

						We are allowed to shoot inside the Zero G-plane of Novespace.
						Thanks to the Geman Space Agency DLR! We arrived today in
						Bordeaux. Marie de Villepin, my DOP Nikolai and make-up-artist Aya
						Yabuuchi.<br /> Actually only Marie is allowed to be inside the
						plane. We are provided with a special cameramen, who is
						experienced to shoot in zero gravity, Pierre Weller.<br /> At 14
						h was the briefing. I thought weightlessness appears, when the
						plane has its nose down, but actually it is the opposite! When the
						plane has its nose up, it will suddenly stop the climb and during
						the following parabola there will be no gravity for 22 seconds!<br />
						We brought a 35mm camera. It is the first time, such a camera is
						inside this plane. But they approved it!<br /> The crew is cool,
						the plane looks great, I am really exited. Marie also! She is cool
						and has no fear at all!

						The last day of our shooting!!!<br /> It rained and it was a grey
						day in Moscow.<br /> Could a last day be a little bit more
						beautiful?<br /> The grip guys refused to pull the dolly. I could
						not believe it!<br /> They said another person must be hired for
						that. Russian crews are more crazy then crews in th US. They also
						ask for one hour lunch break!<br /> It appeared that a helmet
						from the capsule was lost from the day before and Roskosmos
						demanded immediate payment of 2000 Euros.<br /> At the second
						location we were only allowed to shoot three hours, as in Russia
						it was a public holiday. We had one more location, but there was
						not a lot to shoot anymore. I filmed my main actors singing very
						nice songs inside the ISS-mock up (Marie) and in front of the the
						mock-up (Alexander).<br /> In the evening the crew partied again
						in the basement of the hotel.

						Our third day at Star City.<br /> The first location was a
						training room for cosmonauts called “Exit 2″. It is a kind of
						surreal location, with green walls. Perfect for the dream like
						opening sequence of the film. Marie was put into a spacesuit and
						flew on wires through the room. I asked for some unlogic light
						effects and we shot 48 frames per second.<br /> The second
						location was a Soyuz training capsule. We shot very different
						situations: Cosmonauts entering the rocket, cosmonauts flying and
						Gagarin pulls Julie out of the Capsule after her landing, when she
						lost conscience. One of my three cosmonauts was missing, as he did
						not get his Kazakh passport on time and my production manager
						Andrei did his best to replace him!

						Our second day in Moscow.<br /> We shot at the centrifuge. I am
						unable to describe this place, one has too google a picture in the
						web.<br /> It is a giant hammer, spinning in a huge round room,
						and inside that cosmonauts are tested for their ability to fly to
						space. We attached the camera to the centrifuge with a special
						manufactured grip mount, as the forces of the centrifuge are HUGE,
						and it was a big danger, that the camera just would splash against
						the wall!!!<br /> We spent more hours to take amazing shots from
						every angle and then shot the scenes how Gagarin is being taken
						inside the centrifuge and one more scene Julie is taken out of
						that thing!<br /> The workers from the centrifuge were really
						helpful!

						First shooting day in Moscow.<br /> Amazing location: Hydro-Lab

						order to finish the shots with the divers. But then we were asked
						to finish also all other scenes before 5 pm.<br /> When will be

						Today most people woke up with a headache from yesterday’s party.<br />
						I went to scout the two cinemas in Baikonur as possible venues for
						a premiere in 2011.<br /> At 13h the bus left with my Kazakh crew
						members. Time to say good-bye.<br /> At 16h the remaining crew of
						10 people took the plane from Baikonur to Moscow. With 600 KG
						excess luggage (camera and sound equipment).<br /> The flight was
						only three hours short. All equipment arrived! But the bus ride
						from the airport to our hotel took 4 hours!! Moscow… what a
						nightmare!<br /> Fortunately we stay in the outskirts near Star
						City. Our hotel is a kind of sanatorium for elderly people and
						families.

						Last day in Baikonur. Tomorrow we will say good-bye to the Kazakh
						crew and fly to Moscow.<br /> Again my team waited an hour on the
						bus, until authorization arrived that we can enter the cosmodrome…
						We were allowed to go to launch control centre, but no one worked
						there and all panels were dead. We shot a couple of amazing
						details (I switched the start key for the Soyuz-rocket!!). In the
						evening we went to the Energia launch pad.<br /> Delapitated, but
						impressing. In one hour before dusk, we finished the scene of the
						last meeting with Julie and Gagarin.<br /> After dinner we went
						partying at the “Grand” club in Baikonur. Again strippers went on
						stage… Why on earth is this project always connected to
						strip-clubs?

						Today started like I was always afraid of: we could not shoot…<br />
						We went to the assembly factory buiding. We passed two security
						checkpoints, and then just in front of the hall (with all the
						beautiful rockets…) some security boss came and said he would not
						allow us to shoot there. We waited two hours in the bus, my
						production manager all the time on the phone with Moscow, until we
						could go in, but just for an hour and a half… We shot that scene
						really quickly and then rushed to the observation point, where we
						prepared for the final meeting of Gagarin and Julie at sunset. We
						shot just one angle (the other one we will shoot tomorrow with the
						same light) and then we waited two hours until 21 h. And then….
						boooooOOOOOOMMMMM! PROTON-rocket launched from Gagarin launch pad.
						Amazing, AMAZING! For most of my crew it was the first time to see
						it!

						Wow!<br /> Today we were at Gagarin’s launch pad, working under
						the strict conditions given by the security boss of the launch
						pad. We shot a nice scene with the orthodox priest, who blessed
						the rocket. Quickly after that he blessed my actors!<br /> Then
						the overall security boss came, and he gave permition to shoot at
						every place we were not allowed to shoot at all the last three
						days (and which I became obsessed with).<br /> Great shots, great
						scenes! My actors and I went to the rocket (which will be launched
						today) and they stepped up the stairs like real cosmonauts. Great!
						Great!! Great!!!<br /> I would not have allowed all that, if I
						would be in charge!!!

						Today was our first day at the cosmodrome with a big crew. We shot
						at Gagarin’s launch pad, the very same launch pad where Gagarin
						took off to space!<br /> We shot three scenes with Timur and
						Gagarin talking. Unfortunately it was too windy to shoot the scene
						of Gagarin and<br /> Julie’s last meeting. But I used the time to
						get more familiar with the place.<br /> Everybody went to bed
						really early, as we must wake up tommorow at 4 am…

						We left at 7 am with a bus from Roskosmos to the main gate. There
						an old bus drove us to a cemetery 40 min. east from Baikonur,

						large fence built around it, like the one in Aitmatov’s novel
						about Baikonur.<br /> It is cold here, but sunny. We shot nice

						The party ended with a big fight, because one helper from art
						department filmed secretely one actress during a nude scene. He
						was so stupid and drunken and went to showed the video to her
						during the party, claiming he found it in the internet. She came

						him, that he found the clip in the internet and then he admitted,
						that he shot it himself. The actrice beat him up herself. Other

						We went to a military training camp and shot a scene at their
						fence.<br /> The fence looks like the one in Baikonur, but
						shooting such thing is<br /> much nicer here in Kapchagay, where
						we stay in a nice hotel and where<br /> we work with no
						restrictions. We finished our day’s programme in the<br />
						afternoon and went back to our village, where we re-shot one<br />
						dolly-shot, which technically needed a re-shoot. Sitora came back
						from<br /> Tashkent and tomorrow we shoot with her.

						Today we shot with 18 stuntmen, horses and camels. 76 people on

						to run! My second unit camera broke, hopefully Kazakh film studio

						riding on the horse!<br /> The shots are for the beginning of the

						dressed the “enemy” village with costumes from the movie “The

						Today was maybe the longest shooting day in my life!<br /> We

						tried to do a casting, which did not give me a lot of hope, as

						shepherds’ daughter through a flock of sheep!<br /> The second
						scene was the love scene between Gagarin and Julie. It was the

						actors. But they did a great job, beeing just as embarrassed as
						necessary for the characters. The location, a kind of cave near
						Ili river was stunning, but very hard to reach. The shoot lasted
						until 7am. Some crew members worked 21 hours non stop! I am forced
						to give most people another day off on Monday. But I do it with

						The last day of shooting week 1.<br /> We shot a simple scene, in
						which Gagarin is driving in a truck back to his village.<br /> To
						mount the camera took 3 hours. The shooting of the scene took five
						minutes. That is frustrating, that I have very little time to work
						with the actors on the set, because lighting takes most time.<br />
						At 6 pm Marie de Villepin arrived on the set. She arrived already
						early in the morning but slept all day. We made a quick costume
						test for the wedding dress (which will be custom tailored) and she
						went back to the hotel. Two cameramen were filming how she met
						Alexander for the first time: My assistant from Berlin Ivi filmed
						from the point of view of Marie and Roman, my documentary
						filmmaker from Almaty shot from Alexander’s point of view. I must
						now decide, how we do the editing of this interesting documentary
						project about the reality behind the fiction of two very different
						people meeting each other.
					</p>
					<p>
						At 20 h we arrived in the village. We had to wait four hours to
						shoot, because the cabeling of the generator was not prepared.
						Also a crane came with a big lamp came, but they forgot to bring
						enough cables. So the crane for the lamp was standing right next
						to the generator, 100 metres away from the village on the mountain
						top. To our luck the lamp was bigger then ordered (18 KW ARRIMAX),
						so the moon was still visible.<br /> When we finished the first
						scene it started to rain. For continuity reasons we finished all
						night scenes of that day. At 4 h we wrapped, but because we had to
						wait for the camera people to pack, the bus left at 5 h in the
						morning. The light people worked even one hour longer.

						Today was a exhausting day.<br /> I wanted to shoot rocket pieces
						falling on my village.<br /> We had two cranes, stunt people and
						my art direction people made smoke (= visual effects), by
						attaching pieces of burning rubber to the pieces before letting
						them fall.<br /> We started with two wide shots, with a large
						area of action.<br /> There were extras to orchestrate. They come
						from the nearby village and some of them speak only Kazakh. My
						Kazakh crew from Almaty speaks mostly only russian. So sometimes
						Kazakh people can not speak to Kazakh people!
					</p>
					<p>
						For each shot I designed a diagram, who to run where and what
						pieces to fall where, together with my stunt coordinator.<br />
						It worked very well except for two situations, when Sitora was
						running close to falling pieces and one situation, when during a
						rehearsal one piece fall accidentally very close to a stuntmen.
						Sitora was shocked, but brave enough to continue to shoot. The
						stuntmen laughed, after this big piece nearly fall on him. The
						lesson I learned, is to always use stunt doubles for dangerous
						situations, even if my stunt coordinator approves my actor
						performing a take.
					</p>
					<p>The art department people managed to have a big long rocket
						piece falling from the crane and sticking into the ground like a
						knife. That was really impressing. My art director Rustam and his
						crew did a great job!</p>
					<p>
						In the evening we celebrated Immos 32th anniversary with a big
						cake.<br /> People are sitting in the restaurant together all
						evening with their laptops and having fun.<br /> They talk to
						each other and chat to their friends back home at the same time.

						We started “late” (7 pm) today with a small crew in two cars and
						shot some scenes with Gagarin and his grandfather in the nature. I
						like to work with 8 people. My DOP Nikolai doesn’t. I like to
						shoot fast and many different set ups, he prefers to repeat one
						scene more often and make it perfect. I would like to use our
						small camera more often, he prefers the monster 535… I try to
						fullfill all of his wishes, but he seems not happy with the
						equipment we have. Instead of the nice Zeiss lenses, he wishes to
						shoot on Cooke lenses, and yesterday he asked for lightdoubles for
						my actors with same size and skintones. He worked many years as
						electrician and assistant on big american movies. The equipment I
						can afford, will never compare to that…<br /> In the afternoon we
						went to my little village and shot the first interior scene,
						Rustam, Gagarin and the dog watching TV. It took a long time to
						prepare but the dog was great!<br /> Today we thought we heard
						the noise of thunder. In fact, it was the noise of military
						training somewhere in the distance…
					</p>
					<p>We came home late. In the middle of nowhere the police
						stopped our bus to check our papers. Strange country!</p>

						The day started at 5 am.<br /> At 6 am we went to the location.<br />
						I was worried, because the first prop I needed today, a windmeter,
						did not arrive on time.<br /> My art director Rustam does not
						speak English and when he ignores deadlines, I really get
						frustrated.<br /> I changed the schedule and we shot two scenes
						on the nearby mountain.<br /> I was finished with today’s
						programme around lunch, but could not shoot tomorrow’s programme,
						as the art department did not have the set ready. So we took a nap
						in the early afternoon, and shot two more scenes in the early
						evening.<br /> We had a big crane today (GFM), which worked
						perfectly. Just we had no cable for the monitor, so I had to go on
						the crane with my cameramen for quite a few shots. From up there
						you see that around my village the entire steppe is brown, just
						that little piece where my village is located is green. I suddenly
						understood why the villagers have chosen to live on this place, as
						it is less dry. So no more bad feelings about the green bushes
						around my village.<br /> In the afternoon the camel was
						delivered, which gives the village a real exotic touch.<br /> We
						finished at 20h and went back to the hotel for dinner. I had long
						talks with the art department and I hope to have solved all
						problems on that side.<br /> Apparently we will get our equipment
						tomorrow evening from custom terminal!

						The day before Day 1…<br /> Kazakh-Kinostudija drives me crazy.
						They refused to give us the camera without their truck. Finally we
						got it, without them, but they seem to try to rent all their
						personnel and vehicles to me (two months ago, they told me that
						all their equipment was rented…). Anyway…<br /> I drove all day
						around with my cameramen Nikolai to define where to shoot the
						horse and camel riding chase hunt. We drove back and forth and
						finally the choices seemed to be logic. And then Jaydoc, the stunt
						coordinator arrived with his lovely wife (who will be the double
						for Sitora). We discussed how to orchestrate the horses, when we
						shoot the scenes at the end of the month. I want old horseback
						riders. My casting director will go and make auditions with the
						riders this week.<br /> At 14 h I went with my crew to the
						location. I was behaving like a tourist guide, showing them all
						houses, as if we were in a museum. We rented an old bus that will
						bring us to location and back every day. The driver was good,
						because he does not slow down at each hole (there are many on the
						streets), so he even overtook our jeep!<br /> The camera crane
						also arrived. I rented it already today, just to make sure, that
						there will be no problems tomorrow. Everything is set, except one
						prop for the first scene, which Rustam is still constructing. He
						promised to wake me up at 1 am, so I still could give ideas for
						changes.<br /> We had a tractor shaving the green bushes around
						the location. This is the only thing that makes me unhappy. My
						steppe is green! Everywhere around it is brown, just my little
						piece of land did not dry out during this summer. Nobody can
						explain why!<br /> I hope it will match with the scenes in
						Baikonur.<br /> At 20 h I had all my crew (we are 45 people now!)
						sitting in one round. I put a poster in the center and spoke about
						the way I want to shoot this film. It was not as religious as I
						hoped, but I hope I conveyed some of the importance I needed to
						convey (sorry for my bad English!).<br /> I just had a last
						costume and make up check. Teona and Olga now have to make the
						chosen costume for Gagarin look older (patinate it). And in 5
						hours we will wake up. At 6 am the bus leaves to location. And
						hopefully soon after I will say, “Roll sound… roll camera…
						Action!”.

						More arrivals&#8230; The morning flights brought our japanese make
						up artist Aya from Paris and sound recordist Immo from Berlin. Aya
						managed to have her heavy luggage accepted without paying excess
						luggage. Immo didn&#8217;t&#8230;<br /> I went with my DOP
						Nikolai and my Art director Rustam to the location and we spoke
						about the final changes. A bunch of local extras came. They look
						really great. But when I did a rehearsal I understood, I cannot
						use them as actors&#8230;<br /> Then Sitora, the actress playing
						Nazira, came and we tested some more local horses. The village
						really starts to live the moment horses run through its
						streets&#8230;<br /> When we came back to the hotel for lunch,
						production manager Stasya impressed us all with a satellite dish
						that gives us high speed internet! It is really funny to see, how
						everybody run to get their laptops and start to contact their
						friends and relatives!<br /> I think I was the happiest one of
						all, as I could skype with my little son, who is back in Germany.<br />
						In the afternoon we had make up and costume tests with Erbulan,
						the actor who plays the grandfather.<br /> And then I went to
						drive around the nearby steppe to scout undefined locations. I
						found a military camp, with a long fence, which hopefully can
						stand for Baikonur (every scene I don&#8217;t have to shoot in
						Baikonur will save a lot of money).<br /> Shooting is approaching
						so rapidly! I am not nervous, but I sometimes have the feeling, by
						solving all the little problems, I lost the view of the big
						picture. So many decisions have been made such a long time ago and
						now I must live with them. Not that I feel unhappy with the
						screenplay, with the cast, the set construction, or my team. But I
						see that my creative freedom is limited by the choices I&#8217;ve
						done so far. I am a piece of a big machine and I hope this machine
						is running in the right direction. Focusing on one scene is a
						strange thing to do, when I know that later this scene just lasts
						a few seconds n the film. Every scene must be perfect, but one
						should not elaborate on it if it&#8217;s not the most important
						scene. There are scenes that are just scenes. Not every scene must
						tell more then what it was written for. That is the key idea I
						must remind myself of! The reason why each scene was ultimately
						written! Nothing else.<br /> Ok, I am nervous. The good thing
						about all the problems we have is, that they keep my mind busy, so
						I don&#8217;t have a lot of time for being nervous.

						I try to remember how it was four years ago, before the start of
						the shooting of my last movie. I wish everything would be set, and
						I could rehearse with my actors. But we have problems to rent
						equipment in Kazakhstan. It seems that for every tripod you rent,
						a person will come to hold it. I wanted so much a small crew of
						15-20 people. And now we are growing to 35-50 people. We must have
						firemen and a doctor on set, three security guys already sleep on
						location (armed!) and it cost me half an hour to convince my
						location manager not to rent a truck (with a driver of course),
						who will provide us with water.<br /> Today came an email from
						Sundance saying that they want me to submit the film to the
						festival! I wish I could! Or maybe not… I am happy that I still
						have the shoot in front of me.

						Today my 1. AD Artur, my production manager Christin and I went
						through the shooting schedule. I like to print cards for each

						Sunday off. First week seems to be easy, which is a good thing.
						The second week already is a tough thing, with lots of animals and
						stuntmen…<br /> In the afternoon we were locking the plan and I
						called in the supporting actors and hurried to sign contracts with
						them. Some really great actors came, like Turakhan Sydykova, an
						old women, who took her Dombra along and played a wunderful song.
						I had to promise her (it wasn’t difficult) to include her
						instrument in the film. A young actor (it will be his first role)

						signing contracts can be a magic ceremony!

							My appartment in Almaty is in an old soviet style block, situated
							behind new fancy shiny skyscrapers, signposts of the economic
							wealth of this city.<br /> In the morning I tend to ask my first
							meeting to bring fresh bread, so I have breakfast.<br /> This
							morning it was my costume designer talking to me about the bridal
							dress and my casting director Galina showing me auditions for the
							supporting cast.<br /> The afternoon was kept for finally
							signing a hotel deal for me, my crew and my actors for the next
							six weeks.<br /> I have a choice of several hotels in the
							steppe. But so far I was not satisfied with the offers I had.
						</p>
						<p>
							Where will we shoot?<br /> I wanted from the beginning to build
							a village.<br /> I wanted to have a density of weird buildings,
							which can’t be found in reality.<br /> A year ago I found the
							place to build the village on Google earth.<br /> The quest was:
							where to find the nearest steppe near the main Kazakh city
							Almaty.<br /> Because to build around Baikonur would have been a
							logistic nightmare. Everything related to the small film industry
							in Kazakhstan is located in or near the former capital.<br />
							Kapchagai, one hour north is the point, where the steppe starts.
							As there is a lake and several casinos (!), there is for
							Kazakhstan a unusual choice of hotels.<br /> Read this, if you
							want to know about this strange place:<br /> <a
								href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/world/asia/23kazakh.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/world/asia/23kazakh.html</a>
						</p>
						<p>
							I wanted to put my crew in one place called “MoreLux”, but with
							every meeting, the owner decided to raise the price tag some
							thousand dollars higher and finally gave up negotiating.<br />
							Today I signed a contract with a hotel called Robinson. Also
							right next to the lake, and in close distance to my village, it
							hopefully will help to motivate my crew after long hours of
							shooting in the steppe.<br /> It is quite funny to sign a
							contract for 1615 nights. But as season will be over next week,
							it is affordable.

							I am flying to Almaty, Kazakhstan.<br /> Like so many times
							during the last four months.<br /> But this time it is not for
							2-3 days… It is for 2 and a half months…<br /> Because we’ll
							start shooting!!!<br /> In 10 days.<br /> I can’t believe what
							I’m writing here!<br /> Every movie has its magic, but this
							project for sure is most special!<br /> “Baikonur” will be my
							fourth feature film, but there is no routine here.<br />
							Everything is new again. Kazakhstan… why Kazakhstan??<br />
							Almost three years ago I met screenwriter Sergej Askenazy during
							the mixing session of the Czech version of “Absurdistan”. His son
							Alexej worked as assistant sound mixer at Interaudio (the
							beautiful former Geyer mixing lab). He asked if his father could
							visit the day after. I wondered, why Sergej (who I only knew from
							his work) would come to a mixing session and I hoped, that he
							would ask me to work with him. I like to work with experienced
							writers, but I like them to write something based on my ideas.<br />
							So I pitched Sergej this old idea of mine, to make a movie in
							Baikonur. He loved that idea. The rest is history.<br /> We were
							inspired by some old news clippings about lost cosmonauts in the
							steppe, villagers collecting space garbage and billionaires
							travelling to the International Space station ISS as tourists, 20
							million a ticket!<br /> I created a package of altogether three
							movie projects and applied for a MEDIA slate funding, a fund
							dedicated for growing medium size film production companies. And
							I got it. Even though I love my company being small and staying
							small, I suddenly had resources to pay writers good money for
							good work!<br /> The tricky part of MEDIA is… you must match
							every Euro they give you with another Euro you invest, or someone
							else invests. In the case of “Baikonur” the Medienboard
							Berlin-Brandenburg was really brave to get on board on a base of
							14 pages treatment. Sergej and I went to Baikonur in May 2009 and
							made an extensive research. Arte came on board and the German
							broadcasters RBB and BR. I started to do a very international
							casting and went to Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles. I
							found Marie de Villepin for the female lead.<br /> Then I
							started casting in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kirgizstan and Russia.
							My Russian casting director found Alexander Asochakov and my
							Uzbek casting director found Sitora Farmonova. But most of the
							actors will come from Almaty.<br /> With a little bit of
							pushing, three more government funds joined the Medienboard: FFA
							(the national fund), BKM (the cultural fund) and DFFF (the new
							German tax shelter). And four years after the shooting of
							“Absurdistan” I am preparing the shoot of my new movie! Four
							years so far is the cycle I have chosen for making my movies. It
							gives me enough time to prepare an promote each project.<br />
							Today is August 25… (happy birthday mum!), I am sitting on a
							plane to Almaty, Kazakhstan!!!

							German space tourist, became Julie Mahé, a French space tourist.
							Balara is now called Nazira, Adam became Rustam, Bachor is now
							Timur. Apart from the names, the opening sequence has also been

							Sergej did a great job researching space travel through books and
							the internet, but it lacked a feeling of realism.<br /> Since
							working with Gordan Mihic, the screenwriter of such fantastic
							films as “Time of the Gypsies” and “Black Cat, white Cat”, I know
							about the importance of investigating reality before embarking
							into a fairy tale.<br /> Sergej and I needed to see the place
							where rockets are launched.<br /> A trip to space costs 20 Mio.
							USD (or 35 Mio. USD, if you travel two weeks instead of one).<br />
							For a trip to see a space launch at Baikonur, travel agents in
							the internet asked for 4000 Euros. I contacted a travel agent in
							Kazakhstan and booked two trips for half the price. Still quite
							expensive, but I felt necessary.<br /> Another option would have
							been to ask for an official press invitation. But I felt i was
							not ready yet, to answer the inevitable questions about the
							project. I wanted to visit Baikonur rather as a tourist.<br />
							On May 25, 2009 Sergej and I travelled by plane from Berlin via
							Istanbul, Almaty to Kzyl-Orda. We then were supposed to take a
							train to Baikonur. As Sergej recalled numerous bad experiences of
							travelling by train in former Soviet countries, he asked the
							driver who took us from the airport to the train station to
							continue the ride for four more hours (and 80 dollars) and we
							reached Baikonur.<br /> Baikonur is in the middle of nowhere. It
							was a former secret city, not indicated on official maps. And
							still today, you need a special permit to enter the city. The
							local contact man was waiting for us at the gate. Soldiers were
							checking the cars and papers. After 40 hours of travelling, we
							finally arrived.<br /> Our hotel had little comfort. But we did
							not complain, as our mission was to work, not to take a vacation.<br />
							Every morning at 8 am, a car came to pick us up and brought us to
							the space station, around 30 kilometres north of the city. The
							workers had already left at 6 am with seven trains, bringing them
							to the different platforms.<br /> The rockets are built in
							Russia and assembled and launched in Baikonur. The assembly halls
							looked less spectacular than I imagined. Our tour included many
							memorial sites and museums. I started to worry, what places to
							use as locations for the film.<br /> We tried as much as
							possible to see places off the beaten track and to speak with
							workers and inhabitants of Baikonur about their daily life.<br />
							On our last day in Baikonur, a Soyuz TMA rocket started with
							three cosmonauts. Thanks to our new friends from the press
							department, Sergej and I were allowed to be in the
							VIP-department, when the cosmonauts were getting the permission
							to go. The experience to see a rocket taking off was unique and
							unforgettable.

							5.000 Euros were missing for “Baikonur”. I asked the Nipkow
							Foundation to grant me a six months scholarship. Three months
							were granted, so the development of “Baikonur” was financed.<br />
							I was able to extend my scholarship later for one additional
							month. Also the Nipkow programme contributed financially to my
							location tour to Baikonur and gave valuable feedback to my
							screenplay.<br /> Nipkow Programme was founded in 1992. The
							original purpose was to invite filmmakers from Eastern Europe to
							come to Berlin and to initiate international co-productions. Many
							famous filmmakers profited by the support and the contacts they
							received by the Nipkow programme. Many of them stayed in Berlin.
							One of them is my screenwriter Serge Ashkenazy.<br /> During the
							last years, the Nipkow programme repositioned themselves as a
							network open to filmmakers from all European countries. And so
							filmmakers from Berlin are not excluded anymore!<br /> Two very
							active and smart ladies run the Nipkow programme: Uta Ganschow
							and Petra Weissenburger.

							Sergej has a family to support. He could not work for free.<br />
							It was obvious that we needed to travel to Baikonur after writing
							the first draft, to do some research. All that costs money.<br />
							My previous film “Absurdistan” had received a development grant
							by the MEDIA programme of the European Union. The application
							process was a nightmare, full of European bureaucracy. But it was
							good money to start with. I decided to go a step further and to
							make an application for a slate funding, i.e. to apply for
							development support for three projects at the same time. The
							other projects were “Halola” and “Kabul, Germany”.<br /> My
							friend Bakthyar Khudojnazarov first told me about the idea of
							“Halola” ten years ago. It was a project about a stunning Muslim
							wedding rite. We engaged Kirgyz writer Zunwas Arbadu to write the
							treatment and the screenplay. Bakhtyar shall direct the film once
							he completes his project “Waiting for the sea”, and I will
							produce it.<br /> The third project is based on a newspaper clip
							from the “International Herald Tribune” about a US training camp
							in a Bulgarian village. I hired filmmaker Ahmet Golbol to write a
							treatment and the screenplay. For the development of these three
							projects I budgeted 140.000 Euro. MEDIA would grant me according
							to their regulations 50 %.<br /> I entered the application in
							November 2007.<br /> Simultaneously I applied for screenwriting
							support for Baikonur at the Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg, the
							regional film fund, where my company is based.<br /> I applied
							for 25.000 Euros and was granted 20.000 two months later.<br />
							MEDIA took five months to decide. As 70.000 Euros is the minimum
							support for slate funding, that&#8217;s what I received.

							Casting is more important to me, then it is to many other
							directors.<br /> For my last film “Absurdistan”, I casted in 28
							countries.<br /> For “Baikonur”, I hired casting directors in
							Germany, France, UK, and the US to find a suitable Rose Dorn. For
							all the other roles I hired casting directors in Moscow, Tashkent
							and Almaty.<br /> Rose Dorn is written as a German woman. But I
							think she could also be French, Canadian or Swedish. Nathalie
							Bialobos, my casting director in Paris, was the first who
							finished the auditions. She never invites many actresses, but
							always makes excellent choices. On December 4th 2009, I went to
							Paris for the callback. I was especially interested in one model,
							who did an excellent audition. There was one more prominent
							actress, who did not want to audition before meeting me. So we
							met a week later, and she did a great audition.<br /> The
							casting in London happened a few days before Christmas. There
							were many great actresses around the world, but none were as
							charming as my French actresses.<br /> In January, I went to
							L.A. and New York. The protagonist of my documentary film,
							“Behind the Couch”, Zora DeHorter, who is a casting director, had
							already auditioned hundreds of actors. I watched the auditions
							through a new website (CAZT) and chose the finalists I wanted to
							meet in person.<br /> CAZT provides casting studios for free.
							They charge the actors who are interested to see their audition
							online. Sounds like a rip-off, but as the actors must not pay, it
							saves the producer money.<br /> In New York I rented a space and
							made the casting all by myself, including camera. Quite
							exhausting…

							The day after my meeting with Sergej, I e-mailed him the links
							about space tourism and space garbage. We exchanged a few
							thoughts and then… silence.<br /> Two months later, Sergej
							e-mailed me the first treatment. Full of excitement and anxiety,
							I opened the file and…it was written in Russian!<br /> Sergej
							comes originally from Odessa. He lives in Berlin since 1990. I
							can speak German with him, but he writes in Russian.<br />
							Sergej introduced me to Wolfram Spanier, a translator, who is
							known to be a genius in translating screenplays from Russian to
							German. Based on his reputation, I engaged Wolfram to translate
							the treatment. Then Sergej told me that Wolfram does not speak
							Russian. I could not believe my ears. I became nervous. Sergej
							calmed me down. Five days later Wolfram e-mailed me a translation
							that reads like poetry.<br /> I love Sergejs writing style. His
							prose is so poetic. The elements I required were all in there,
							and also many new ideas. But as I had previously experienced with
							other eastern European writers, it was rather non-linear. Scenes
							describing the plot were mixed with scenes establishing
							characters or the location. There were also flashback scenes
							without a dramaturgical need. I am not interested in extremely
							story-driven films. I like to place my films in unusual locations
							and I like special characters. But my aim is to interweave in
							every scene all of the three: character development, set-up of
							location and progress of plot.<br /> It was definitely too early
							to go into the screenwriting process. I asked Sergej to rewrite
							the treatment.<br /> The second treatment was a big step
							forward. I wished to be able to continue that process, but taking
							Sergej&#8217;s wishes into consideration, we decided to move
							forward entering the scriptwriting process.

					<h3 class="entry-title">Idea of Baikonur</h3>

							I cannot remember exactly when I had the idea to shoot a movie
							about Baikonur.<br /> For many years, newspaper clips and
							pictures about Cosmonauts have attracted my attention.
						</p>
						<p>But a location is not a story…</p>
						<p>When I was sound-mixing my last movie “Absurdistan”, the
							assistant sound mixer Alexej asked me if his father Sergej could
							come visit us the following day. I never met Sergej, but I knew
							that he is a known screenwriter. I agreed and started to guess
							about a possible reason for his visit. I could not imagine that
							he would be interested in watching the sound mix (a rather
							technical process!) and speculated, that Sergej was keen to write
							for me. As I had not yet lined up any new project, I saw the
							opportunity of Sergej and I developing a screenplay together,
							which could become my fourth feature film. While thinking what to
							propose to him, I remembered the idea of making a movie about
							Baikonur. That day, my sound mixers worked long hours. They would
							tinker about one or two hours for a 15-second scene, to offer me
							the best of all possible mixes of 80 tracks. To give valuable
							input, I stayed outside the studio and only went inside once they
							had achieved a good preliminary result. While sitting outside,
							instead of counting the minutes, I started researching about
							Baikonur, preparing for Sergej Ashkenazy&#8217;s visit the next
							day. Google showed me a million results for “Baikonur”. I also
							tried combinations, such as “Baikonur – accidents”. Terrible
							stories about the tragic explosion of the Buran space shuttle
							appeared. I tried “Baikonur – funny” and reports about nearby
							villages popped up, telling stories about villagers collecting
							rocket pieces that fall down in the steppes after a rocket
							starts.</p>
						<p>I was struck by this contrast between space tourism and
							space garbage.</p>
						<h3>Space tourism…</h3>
						<p>Five persons have visited the international space station
							after paying 20 – 30 Million USD. Among them, Microsoft manager
							Charles Simonyi and Iranian–American business woman Anousheh
							Ansari.</p>
						<h3>Space garbage…</h3>
						<p>When a rocket travels to the orbit, large parts of it fall
							down to the steppe (propulsion stages). I found a newspaper clip
							about villagers in Kazakhstan, who collect those parts and build
							houses with them.</p>
						<p>And then there were pictures about cosmonauts returning to
							earth, landing with their capsules into the steppe. One of those
							pictures particularly took my attention: A capsule in the steppe
							that was approached by villagers hours before the rescue team
							came.</p>
						<p>
							Looking back, all elements of the final story were already there
							and yet, I was still two treatments and six drafts away from the
							final screenplay.<br /> When I pitched the idea to Sergej the
							following day, I found a writer fascinated by space exploration.
							We agreed that Sergej would write a treatment first, before we
							entered into contractual obligations.

							There are two worlds: the world of space, and the world of the
							steppe. At first we see the former. A rocket is being launched.
							It will carry three people into orbit, two cosmonauts and one
							tourist, a young German girl named Rose Dorn. Emitting a mighty
							roar, the rocket blasts off into the starry, black void.<br />
							The village of Kedej, a hundred kilometers from Baikonur. Its
							buildings are strangely shaped, as if they’ve descended into the
							desert steppe from a science fiction painting. Silvery titanium
							cylinders under gold foil roofs and low moon-white cupolas topped
							with multi-colored striped spires rise above the shimmering
							surface of a dried-up salt lake. Occasional brown felt yurts
							darken the landscape. The Kedejans make their living from an
							unusual business. They search for and collect spent rocket
							stages, fuel tanks, and spherical booster fairings.
						</p>

						<p>After cleaning off the remnants of fuel, they use them to
							build houses, garages, and enclosures for their animals. They
							sell the leftovers to the Chinese. The entire village takes part
							in the business. Only old people live here. The young have left
							the village long ago, unless you count Kandrar, the grandson of
							old Adam, and an eccentric, somber, unsociable girl named Balara.
							Her dishevelled hair and sloppy, shapeless tunic can often be
							glimpsed in the village square. The villagers dislike Balara and
							consider her practically mad.</p>
						<p>And now about love. It began when the young Kedejan,
							Kandrar, caught sight of Rose Dorn, the beautiful space tourist,
							on television. He liked her very much. And later he also heard
							her tender voice on the radio (Kandrar was the village radio
							operator) singing a lullabye from orbit to her little sister in
							Germany. Kandrar was utterly smitten on the spot. But then
							tragedy struck. While returning to Earth from orbit, the space
							tourist and her landing capsule disappeared without a trace. A
							long search was conducted, but to no avail.</p>
						<p>A week later, far into the steppe, Kandrar by pure accident
							suddenly discovered the lost capsule containing Rose Dorn. She
							lay in it like Sleeping Beauty, beautiful and still. Kandrar
							thought she was dead, but soon realized she was asleep in a deep
							and heavy coma. That same night he brought Rose secretly into his
							yurt, and hid her there from the neighbors for a long time. He
							dressed her in his mother’s bridal attire, laid her on a white
							carpet, and enjoyed the sight of her sleeping day and night, as
							he burned from unrequited love. But he could not wake her at all.
							Then a dangerous event occurred that threatened the lives of both
							Kandrar and his secret captive. To save her, he covered her with
							his body, placing a fervent kiss upon her rosy lips in a
							despairing farewell. And along with the roar and shuddering of
							the earth from the rocket booster that had fallen close to the
							yurt, his Koketai (meaning tender, as Kandrar had named her)
							awoke&#8230;</p>
						<p>
							Slowly she regained consciousness. At first she remained seated,
							but in a few days she cautiously stood up. Yet her memory had
							still not returned. Who was she and where was she from? Koketai
							could not remember, no matter how she tried. What was this
							strange dwelling she found herself in? And who was this
							unfamiliar boy bustling about her? Kandrar told her the whole
							truth, but Rose didn’t believe it, or more likely she didn’t
							understand what he was saying. Kandrar told her a lie, that she
							was his fiancée who had been long been ill, and had forgotten it.
							More than death he feared that Koketai would leave him if she
							learned the whole truth. He wouldn’t let her out of the yurt. At
							night as she slept soundly, he would sit near her, listening to
							her light breathing, and weep, and whisper words of love, though
							his virtuous nature kept him from touching her. Love’s yearning
							possessed Kandrar at other times as well, as when Koketai was
							washing herself, standing in an old tin washtub with shimmering
							streams of water flowing from her taut breasts and rounded hips,
							while he gazed at her through a window in the yurt and even
							groaned from his overflowing desire…<br /> But everything hidden
							is eventually revealed. They learned of the girl in the village,
							and then at the cosmodrome. Kandrar, to save his love, carried
							Koketai off and hid her in a distant grotto. What happened there
							is what may always happen between a young boy and girl. The night
							of love raised Kandrar to the pinnacle of bliss… and Rose’s
							memory unexpectedly returned. In the morning he went to kiss her,
							but she politely declined.
						</p>
						<p>Important Russian officials from Baikonur came for her, and
							her father, the German millionaire Wolfgang Dorn. They took
							Koketai from Kandrar and brought her back to Germany.</p>
						<p>In gratitude for saving Rose, the officials invited Kandrar
							to work at the cosmodrome. He became a tester of the ejection
							seats that catapult from the ship in case of emergency. They
							began launching him into the air, like a guinea pig, up to ten
							times a day. He’d fly up with smoke and a bang, a sudden silence
							with Kandrar bobbing in his parachute, surveying the area. It was
							all beautiful and interesting, but it couldn’t take the place of
							Koketai for Kandrar; he still loved and waited for her. And she
							returned to the cosmodrome for a new flight into space. Kandrar
							prepared a dinner for her, with local food from his village. Rose
							explained him, that she was going for a long time to understand
							the strange phenomenon many cosmonauts had seen, that of ghostly
							human figures floating in space, who were perhaps an unknown
							extraterrestrial form of life. “What about us?!” exclaimed
							Kandrar. “What about our night together, Koketai!” Taking his
							face in her hand, Rose said quietly, “No, Kandrar, no. That
							wasn’t our night. That night you were with Koketai, and I am not
							she… I have devoted my love to outer space.”</p>
						<p>
							In the morning she flew away. And Kandrar zoomed in his chair
							over the spring steppe and whispered, barely audibly, “Farewell…”<br />
							He landed in some tall grass, unbuckled his parachute, and
							without a glance toward the cosmodrome, went into the steppe.<br />
							Towards evening he mounted into the steep hills and sat,
							arranging his legs under him as his ancestors had done for ages.
							Suddenly he heard a new and tender song. “The Syrtan,” (Bird of
							Happiness &#8211; Kazakh) said Kandrar in amazement.
						</p>
						<p>
							The prophetic bird, shimmering with magical plumage, was sitting
							in the branches of a tamarisk bush, and her voice was enchanting.<br />
							Someone else was watching Kandrar from a nearby low hill, and
							also listening to the wondrous bird. She had changed that night.
							Her hair, combed and gathered back from her forehead, fell onto
							her shoulders in a soft wave. Her face had acquired beauty and a
							joyous, luminous peace in the solemn light of the moon. Her
							perpetually stained tunic had become a marvelous gown. And
							happiness shone in her eyes.<br /> It was Balara.
